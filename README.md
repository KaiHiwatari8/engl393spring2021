## Introduction

If you manage or own a Discord guild with numerous members, you probably use bots to automate common functions such as custom welcome message, reaction roles, YouTube notifications, and much more. Even if you have enough funds, you would probably not want to spend them on having custom bots built for your guild. So, use existing bots? You can but you do not have to unless you do not have programming background. Nevertheless, you can learn to program for free on YouTube anytime. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) is what I would personally recommend.

This tutorial will guide you to program a bot from scratch, add several paid features for free, and host it 24/7 for free.

Wondering why you should learn to create a Discord bot?
* **Custom bot branding**: <br>You can get rid of third-party bots that need you to vote for them to keep using their bot.

* **All features in just one bot**: <br>Instead of managing tons of bots, keep is simple and multi-functioning with just one bot.

* **Personal Project**: <br>Show it off as your personal projects on resume or LinkedIn to demonstrate your skills.

* **Freelance**: <br>Monetize your skills by creating custom bots for people who cannot code on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com), etc.

* **Keep Practicing**: <br>Coding is improved only when you keep practicing to write code and solve problems.

* **Keep Learning**: <br>Keep your brain active by learning a new framework.
